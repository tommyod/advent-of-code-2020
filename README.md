# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
The code was written with the purpose of learning basic C++ through a practical project.

## C++ resources

- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [A Tour of C++](https://www.amazon.com/Tour-2nd-Depth-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832)
- My colleague [@terjew](https://github.com/terjew/)

## Notes

Build using one of:

- cmake
- premake (build system generator which generates make file) (terje recommends)
- make
- scons (Python based)
- maybe look into qtcreator
